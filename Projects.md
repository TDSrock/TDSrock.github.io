# [](#header-1)Projects

On this page you will be able to find links to all my projects. For ease of use these projects are split up in github based projects and non-github based projects.

# [](#header-1)Active projects
#### [](#header-4)Summer Game Project

A project I started with several friends from Univeristy and college. But even including some Australian friends.
This project for now is mostly under-wraps.
For now I will make clear that the project is intended to be built in Unity. The goal is to put down a 2d metroidvania game with strong inspirations from fighting games.

The github repo is currently private and will remain so untill we are further into production that we can really start showing content.

#### [](#header-4)Project Game Development
A school project in which my team decided to create a horror game taking large inspiration from [PT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.T._(video_game)) released on the playstation store several years ago.

The project is still underway and has seen some crazy shifts and turns within the team. Not stuff I am proud of, but still a great moment to learn from.

#### [](#header-4)Elemantalers TD (Rework)
Due to the orginal version of Elementalers having been built in Processing I was forcibly limited in allot of ways. I intend to remake the game alone in C# either using XNA or Unity as a base. The project has seen some developemnt in XNA already but I may decide to opt for unity instead at a later date.

No public repo for this project is currently avaible.

# [](#header-1)Note-able Completed projects
#### [](#header-4) Elementalers_TD (Processing)
This was an extremely fun project. We built a fully working tower defense with pathfinding implemented in it.
Myself and Jan *lastnamehere* were the main contributors to the code base. Most I was responsible for several of parts of the game functions.
Most proudly the Path finding implementation (A*), combination mechanic and the event system built(more acurate name in hindsight would have been the achievment system).

Sadly said event system was made before I was aware of the observer pattern so the implementation is a bit shody but thats okay becuase it worked!
